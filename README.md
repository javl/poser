#Poser#

####Description
Poser lets you commit and push to Github as any user.

####Usage
Simply add your files with `git add` and run `./poser` instead of `git commit -a`. The script will ask you for the username and commit message to use.



####Notice
This script uses a small 'glitch' in the Github system; usernames and images are shown but commits are not actually linked to shown accounts. Thanks to Ed for pointing it out.
